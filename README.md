# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

If you simply download our file "histopathologic_cancer_detection.ipynb" you will be able to run our entire source code in Google Colab. Everything is there and set up to be visually appealing as well as providing a guide throughout our project. We have commands within our Google Colab that will allow you to download our trained model directly from there, so it is not necessary to download the one you see in this repository.

We thank you for your viewing!
