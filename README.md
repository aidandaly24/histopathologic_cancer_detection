# Histopathologic Cancer Detection

If you simply download our file "histopathologic_cancer_detection.ipynb" you will be able to run our entire source code in Google Colab. Everything is there and set up to be visually appealing as well as providing a guide throughout our project. We have commands within our Google Colab that will allow you to download our trained model directly from there, so it is not necessary to download the one you see in this repository.

Steps to running our project:
1. In Google Colab make sure to click Runtime -> Change runtime type -> Hardware accelerator -> GPU
2. Runtime -> Run all

And that's it everything will flow from there!

If you want to attempt to train the model on your own there is a commented out portion at the bottom of our training code in Section 4a, by uncommenting this you will be able to run the training for 30 epochs on 1/6th of our dataset.

<h3>We thank you for your viewing!</h3>
